                                    It is important to be as specific as possible with your questions, otherwise you will likely get ignored.<br /><br /> If you want us to help you, please help us and follow the following guidelines:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Describe the symptoms of your problem or bug carefully and clearly.</li>
                                        <li>Describe the environment in which it occurs (machine, OS, application, whatever). Provide your vendor's distribution and release level (e.g.: “Fedora Core 7”, “Slackware 9.1”, etc.).</li>
                                        <li>Describe the research you did to try and understand the problem before you asked the question.</li>
                                        <li>Describe the diagnostic steps you took to try and pin down the problem yourself before you asked the question.</li>
                                        <li>Describe any possibly relevant recent changes in your computer or software configuration.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    If at all possible, provide a way to reproduce the problem in a controlled environment.<br /><br /> Some examples:<br />

                                <p>Zabbix has been in development since 2001, and is used by a lot of companies. As such, both the <a href="https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zabbix Documentation</a> as Google provide a wealth of information.</p>
                                <p>Chances are that your specific question has been asked before, has been documented and probably has been solved.</p>
                                <p>Nobody likes to repeat themselves, nobody likes to answer the same question over and over. Please read the manual first. Please Google your question first. If both render useless, feel free to ask for support, but ensure you include what you've found and why it didn't work.</p>
